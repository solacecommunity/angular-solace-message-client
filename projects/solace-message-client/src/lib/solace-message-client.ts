   * You can subscribe to multiple topics simultaneously by using wildcard segments in the topic. Topics are case-sensitive and consist of one or more segments, each
   * separated by a forward slash.
   *
   * **Single-Level Wildcard Character (`*`)**:
   * - if a segment contains the asterisk (`*`) character as its only character, this segment is required and acts as a placeholder for any segment value.
   * - if a segment ends with the asterisk (`*`) character, this segment acts as a placeholder for segment values starting with the characters before the asterisk.
   *   The segment to match can have additional characters, must does not have to.
   *
   * **Multi-Level Wildcard Character (`>`)**:
   * -  when used as the last segment, it provides a "one or more" wildcard match for any topics with an identical prefix to the subscription.
   *
   * If a segment begins with a colon (`:`), it is called a named wildcard segment that acts as a placeholder for any value. The characters after the leading colon give the segment its name.
   * Internally, named wildcard segments are translated to single-level wildcard segments. But, named segments allow retrieving substituted segment values when receiving a message in an easy manner.
   * E.g., the topic 'myhome/:room/temperature' is translated to 'myhome/* /temperature', matching messages sent to topics like 'myhome/kitchen/temperature' or 'myhome/livingroom/temperature'.
   * Substituted segment values are then available in {@link MessageEnvelope.params}, or as the second element of the tuple when using {@link mapToBinary} or {@link mapToText}
   * RxJS operators.
   *
   * See https://docs.solace.com/PubSub-Basics/Wildcard-Charaters-Topic-Subs.htm for more information and examples.

   *
   * It is important to understand that a topic is not the same thing as a topic endpoint. A topic is a message property the event broker uses to route a message to its destination.
   * Topic endpoints, unlike topics, are objects that define the storage of messages for a consuming application and need administratively configured on the event broker. Topic endpoints
   * are more closely related to queues than to topics. Messages cannot be published directly to topic endpoints, but only indirectly via topics.
   * For more information, refer to https://solace.com/blog/queues-vs-topic-endpoints.

   * ## Payload
   * A message may contain unstructured byte data, or a structured container. See {@link Data} for further information.

   * Solace supports two delivery modes, also known as qualities of service (QoS):

   *         or structured data in the form of a {@link SDTField}. Alternatively, to have full control over the message to be published, pass the
   *         {@link Message} object instead, which you can construct using {@link SolaceObjectFactory#createMessage}.

  /**
   * Sends a message to the given queue destination. A queue is typically used in a point-to-point (PTP) messaging environment.
   *
   * A queue differs from the topic distribution mechanism that the message is transported to exactly a single consumer, i.e., the message is load
   * balanced to a single consumer in roundâ€‘robin fashion, or is always transported to the same subscription in case of an exclusive queue.
   * When sending a message to a queue, the broker retains the message until it is consumed, or until it expires.
   * Refer to the subsequent chapter 'Durability of Endpoints' for more information.
   *
   * ## Queue destination name
   * Queues are case-sensitive and consist of one or more segments, each separated by a forward slash. The queue name must be exact, thus not contain wildcards.
   *
   * ## Payload

   *
   * You can change the message delivery mode via the {@link PublishOptions.deliveryMode} property.
   * For more information, refer to the documentation of {@link PublishOptions.deliveryMode}.
   *
   * ## Durability of Endpoints
   * Solace distinguishes between durable und non-durable queues.
   *
   * When sending the message to a durable queue, the broker retains the message until it is consumed (and also acknowledged) by the consumer, or until
   * it expires. In constract, a non-durable queue, also known as a temporary queue, has a shorter lifecycle than a durable queue. It has the lifespan
   * of the client that created it, with an additional 60 seconds in case of unexpected disconnect. The 60 seconds provides the client with some time to
   * reconnect to the endpoint before it and its contents are deleted from the Solace broker.
   *
   * Although the terms durable and persistent are related, keep in mind that the concept 'durability' applies to endpoints, whereas 'persistence' applies to event messages.
   *

   *
   * For a detailed comparison, refer to https://solace.com/blog/delivery-modes-direct-messaging-vs-persistent-messaging.
   *
   * ### Direct Messaging (default)
   * Direct messaging is over TCP and provides a reliable, but not guaranteed, delivery of messages from the Solace event broker to consuming clients,
   * and is the default message delivery system. The broker delivers a message one time at most. It is most appropriate for messaging applications
   * that require very high-rate or very low-latency message transmission, i.e., to efficiently publish messages to a large number of clients with matching
   * subscriptions.
   *
   * For more information, refer to https://docs.solace.com/PubSub-Basics/Direct-Messages.htm.
   *
   * ### Persistent or Guaranteed Messaging
   * Persistent messaging is also over TCP but has an additional set of acknowledgments beyond those used by TCP itself. Solace event broker guarantees the message
   * never to be lost and to be delivered at least once. Use persistent messaging when data must be received by the consuming application.
   *
   * Persistent messaging occurs between the publishing application and the broker, and between the broker and the consuming application. If the consuming application
   * is not connected or cannot keep up with the publishing application, the messages are stored in endpoints on the broker.
   *
   * For more information, refer to  https://docs.solace.com/PubSub-Basics/Guaranteed-Messages.htm or https://docs.solace.com/PubSub-Basics/Basic-Guaranteed-Messsaging-Operation.htm.
   *
   * If you experience poor performance when sending guaranteed messages, consider adjusting the size of the publishing window via {@link Session#publisherProperties#windowSize},
   * as described here: https://solace.com/blog/understanding-guaranteed-message-publish-window-sizes-and-acknowledgement
