# Solace Message Client

Angular message client to communicate with a Solace messaging broker for sending and receiving messages using the
native [SMF protocol](https://docs.solace.com/PubSub-ConceptMaps/Component-Maps.htm#SMF) (Solace Message Format) over web socket. This library is based on the low-level Solace JavaScript
Messaging API provided by the [solclient](https://docs.solace.com/API-Developer-Online-Ref-Documentation/js/index.html) library.

This library provides fundamental messaging API to exchange messages via topic destinations, queue and topic endpoints. To get the full functionality of the underlying *solclient* library, you can obtain the native Solace session.
